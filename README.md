# ClairoAI

Clairo is a prompt generation tool that converts unclear requests into structured, optimized prompts for use with large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Instead of generating answers, Clairo produces specialized, copy ready prompts that users can paste into their preferred AI system.

## Core Idea

Users often struggle to write effective prompts.  
Clairo bridges that gap by generating structured prompts tailored to specific use cases.

## Features

- Four specialized modes for different use cases  
- Copy ready prompt generation  
- Session history for authenticated users  
- Streaming output generation  

## Available Modes

### Build an App

Generates five structured prompts for:

- Backend API design  
- Frontend UI structure  
- Database schema  
- Deployment strategy  
- Testing plan  

### Deep Research

Generates three levels of prompts:

- Beginner explanation  
- Technical deep dive  
- Expert analysis  

### Decision Support

Generates two prompts:

- Structured comparison analysis  
- Context based recommendations  



## How It Works

1. User submits a high level request.  
2. Clairo analyzes intent and context.  
3. System selects the appropriate mode structure.  
4. Optimized prompts are generated.  
5. User copies and pastes into their preferred LLM.
